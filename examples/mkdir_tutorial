# Introduction

Hi, in this tutorial you will learn about the `mkdir` command.


# Create a single directory.

You can use `mkdir` to create a directory in the direactory you are crrently
in:

```sh
mkdir some_dir
```

You can see that the directory was created by with the help `ls` command:

```sh
ls -l
```

If the directory you are trying to create already exists, `mkdir` will return
an error:

```sh
mkdir some_dir
```

You can also create a directory in some other directory (then your current one),
by preceding the name of the directory you want to create with a relative path
(from your current directory) to the directory you want to create it in.

```sh
mkdir some_dir/a

ls -l some_dir
```

# Create multiple directories

`mkdir` can create multiple directories at the same time:

```sh
mkdir some_dir/a some_dir/b some_dir/a/c

find ./some_dir
```

# Cleanup

Running the following will delete all directories created in this tutorial:

```sh
rm -fr some_dir
```

By by :)
